# AdvancedBarriers
This is the source files for the AdvancedBarriers plugin.

This plugin is pretty simple, and contains just a tad bit of code. The most notably interesting part of this plugin is the use of the moving piston block. For those who do not know, the moving piston is a temporary block created whenever a piston extends or retracts. This is in place to track how for along the extension the piston is. For a more in depth coverage, visit: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Piston#Moving_Piston

The gist is, it allows players to pass through, and thats it. Mobs are blocked, fluids are blocked, and block placement is blocked. I just thought making a simple plugin out of it would be neat.
